> This package allows embedding non-PDF files (e.g., BibTeX) into PDF with hyperlink.

To install, you can run `tex intopdf.dtx` and copy the generated file `intopdf.sty` to a directory in the search path of your TeX installation.
For quick evaluation, you can also rename `intopdf.dtx` to `intopdf.sty` and use that file directly.
